# Drugs

Currently 5 drugs molecules are provided here, focusing on mainly medication primarily used to treat tuberclosis.

## [Ethambutol - ETB][ethambutol-wiki]
Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide.

## [Isoniazid - NIZ][isoniazid-wiki]
Isoniazid, also known as isonicotinylhydrazide (INH), is an antibiotic used for the treatment of tuberculosis.

## [Rifampicin - RFP][rifampicin-wiki]
Rifampicin, also known as rifampin, is an antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections. This includes tuberculosis, leprosy, and Legionnaire's disease.

## [Pyrazinamide - PZA][pyrazinamide-wiki]
Pyrazinamide is a medication used to treat tuberculosis.[2] For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or ethambutol.

## [Dimethyloxalylglycine - DMOG][dmog-pubchem]
Dimethyloxalylglycine is a cancer treatment drug, proposed to inhibit O<sub>2</sub> consumption in cancer cell lines HCT116 and PC12, well before activation of HIF pathways.

## Methods

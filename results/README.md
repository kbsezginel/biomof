# BioMOF Results

## MOF-5 and GWMOF-8 (PARHEW)
This initial test was performed to estimate drug uptakes in a common MOF (MOF-5) and a calcium adipic acid MOF, GWMOF-8 (CCDC: PARHEW). GWMOF-8 has the largest pore among calcium MOFs in CoRE database. However, it is not able to load RFP due to its 3D pore structure.

## Initial Screening of [CoRE Database][CoRE]
An initial screening of ~80 MOFs were performed using MOFs in [CoRE database][CoRE]. MOFs with Ca, Na, Mg, Sr, and K metal centers, void fraction bigger than 0.3, and largest pore bigger than 6 Ã… were selected.
Overall DMOG, PZA, and NIZ uptakes were generally quite high followed by ETB and RFP. Around 65 of the MOFs weren't able to uptake any RFP since its a relatively large molecule.

## ZIF-8
Drug uptakes have been calculated at 298 K for ZIF-8 using RASPA to estimate maximum drug uptake capacity:

# Calculating theoretical drug loading

## Structures

### MOF
Acquire MOF structure from crystal databases such as CCDC, CoRE.

### Drugs
Generate molecular structure.
- Look for databases: RCSB, PubChem, ChemSpider, DrugBank.
- Draw molecular structure if not in database.
- Optimize molecular geometry.
  - Electronic structure methods (DFT).
  - Force field methods.

For increased accuracy many geometric configurations can be sampled:
- Flexible force fields
- Conformer generation
